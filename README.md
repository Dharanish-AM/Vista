# Vista

**The Ultra-Minimalist New Tab for Focus & Speed**

Reclaim your digital focus with Vista, a Chrome extension designed for developers and minimalists who demand speed, clarity, and aesthetics. Stripping away the chaos of the modern web, Vista replaces your new tab page with a serene, distraction-free environment that loads in under 300ms.

## Features

- **Ultra-Minimal Aesthetics**: A clean, distraction-free interface built with a "less is more" philosophy.
- **Precision Timekeeping**: Features a massive, precision-tuned clock (`HH:MM:SS`) centered for immediate clarity.
- **Developer Typography**: Built entirely using `JetBrains Mono` for a premium, code-native feel.
- **Relatable Insights**: A curated collection of time-aware quotes that offer subtle motivation—from "Coffee first" mornings to "Commit your changes" evenings.
- **Blazing Fast**: Engineered with pure Vanilla JS/CSS (no frameworks) for instant load times and negligible memory usage.
- **Dark Mode Native**: A deep, reliable dark theme that is easy on the eyes, day or night.

## Why Vista?

Vista is for those who find beauty in simplicity. It removes the noise of widgets, search bars, and to-do lists to leave you with only what matters: the present moment. It transforms every new tab into a breath of fresh air. 

**No tracking. No ads. No distractions.**
